# Wordforms-rust
Creates the affixed forms for a given stem in a Hunspell dictionary. Can also generate all words in a dictionary by affixing every stem with its related affixes, which is useful for decompressing Hunspell dictionary data to assess the quality of the dictionary data (how many false positives, etc.).

## To use
Assuming Rust and Cargo are installed, clone the repo, build with `cargo run` and read the help text for details on how to run the tool on a specific dictionary.
